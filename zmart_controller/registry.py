"""The registry: the drivers installed on this computer, and the folder ZMART keeps its files in.

A driver is two files: ``zmart_driver.json``, its name and how to reach the
microscope, and the class file it names, with a ``ZmartDriver`` class (or,
for an older driver, one function per command). :func:`load_driver` reads
them. :func:`register_driver` writes the JSON's path into this computer's
list, ``drivers.json`` in :func:`config_root`, so that every Python session
can connect by name. :func:`get_instruments` shows the list.
