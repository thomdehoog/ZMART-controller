"""The ZmartController: one microscope, one method per command.

Make one with a driver, and it connects::

    from zmart_controller import mic

    mic.connect("my-scope")    # connect to an installed driver
    mic.set_xyz(100, 50, 0)    # every command goes to the microscope connected last

To hold several microscopes at once, keep each one::

    left, right = ZmartController("left-scope"), ZmartController("right-scope")
    left.set_xyz(100, 50, 0)

Each method calls the method of the same name on the ``ZmartDriver``, which
hands back ``True`` and the values, or ``False`` and a message. There are
three outcomes, and the answer always has the same shape:

- success: ``{"success": True, "content": ...}`` with the values;
- failure, the driver says the microscope did not do it:
  ``{"success": False, "content": "..."}`` with the driver's message;
- call failure, the method itself raised: the same, with the error text.

Every call returns when the driver has finished.

A driver may also be a module with one function per command, such as the
mock; its functions already build the answers themselves.
