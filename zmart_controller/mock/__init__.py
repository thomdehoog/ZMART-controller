"""The mock microscope driver: a complete ZMART driver for a pretend microscope.

It is built from the same parts as every ZMART driver, described in
``docs/driver-anatomy.md`` of the ZMART-drivers repository. Underneath it runs
MockScope Control, pretend vendor software in ``testing/mock_api``. Read it as the template for a new driver,
and use it to try workflows without hardware. Plug it in with::

    zmart_controller.set_instrument(zmart_controller.mock)

The functions the controller calls, one per command, are in
``zmart_controller_plugin.py``. They are listed here, which is how the
controller finds them.
