"""Saving one acquisition as ZMART's product, and reporting where it went.

The layout under the output folder is::

    <output_root>/<folder>/<position_label>.ome.tif          one plane
    <output_root>/<folder>/<position_label>_z000.ome.tif     a z-stack, one file per plane
    <output_root>/<folder>/<position_label>.ome.zarr/        OME-Zarr, any number of planes
    <output_root>/<folder>/<position_label>.commands.json    the command log

``folder`` is an acquisition setting. With no folder, the files go
straight into ``<output_root>``.

Nothing is ever overwritten: a second acquisition with the same label gets
``_001``, ``_002`` and so on.
